# fantasy_football_analysis

## Introduction

This is a playground for analysis of NFL player-level data, to help inform fantasy football decisions. It will start off pretty simple then grow over seasons, as I apply more complex analyses and continue to learn more causal inference techniques.

## Where it starts

There is a Jupyter Notebook with exploratory data analyses. This will help define and contextualize the data sources, with visualizations and light analyses. Data sources are found in the "data_sources" folder, and currently consists of a player-level dataset for NFL seasons 2012-2023 sourced from Kaggle. This will also grow.

## Where it will be going

Eventually, my goal is to apply more causal analyses, constructing a knowledge (graph) model of my understanding of the game that will underpin causal inference analyses to inform draft, trades, and roster setting.

Thanks for viewing. Make sure to star/watch, or if you feel so inclined, fork a copy for yourself.
